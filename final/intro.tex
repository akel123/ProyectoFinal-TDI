\section{Introduction}
The properties of relative entropy have been extensively studied in the past in many different contexts and under a variety of different names, but its properties under mappings by stochastic matrices is the main focus of this paper. The results can be used to provide more information on bounding the rates of convergence to equilibrium of ergodic Markov chains and Markov processes. After reviewing some definitions, we will see theorem 3.1 (although omiting the proof) which will be used to prove the the two main results selected for this elaboration: theorems 4.1 and 5.4. Finally, we will see the some of the ideas of this paper in the context of the what we saw throughout the semester.
